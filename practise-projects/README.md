# âœ… Simple Task Manager (Rust CLI)

A simple command-line Task Manager written in Rust. This project allows users to manage a list of tasks in memory â€” add, view, complete, and remove tasks via an interactive menu.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a CLI program that helps users manage a list of tasks, stored in memory. This project is ideal for practicing:

- âœ… Variables and Mutability
- âœ… Data Types (Strings and Vectors)
- âœ… Functions and Modular Code
- âœ… Ownership and Borrowing
- âœ… Control Flow (loops, match, conditionals)
- âœ… Error Handling (invalid input, index out of bounds)
- âœ… Using Cargo to manage the project

---

## ðŸ“¦ What Youâ€™ll Practice

- **Variables and Mutability:** Use mutable variables to manage task states.
- **Data Types:** Work with `String` and `Vec`.
- **Functions:** Write reusable functions for each action.
- **Control Flow:** Handle user interaction via `loop`, `match`, and conditionals.
- **Ownership and Borrowing:** Learn how data is moved or referenced between functions.
- **Cargo:** Set up, build, and run the app with `cargo`.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements

- Display a menu with these options:

  1. Add a task
  2. View all tasks
  3. Mark a task as completed
  4. Remove a task
  5. Exit

- Tasks are stored in a `Vec<String>`.
- Program continues running in a loop until user exits.
- Handle invalid menu options or out-of-range task indices gracefully.
- Each feature (add/view/complete/remove) should be its own function.
